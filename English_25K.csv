I was able to succeed because of your advice.,
We hope to lower the tariff.,
I owe you my life.,
Tom will be in charge while I'm away.,
We know you're interested.,
I don't think I can help you.,
Tom will play tennis tomorrow.,
The attempt ended in failure.,
My TV is broken.,
Tom wanted to talk to Mary face to face.,
I think we need more information.,
Watch out for the car!,
Not a single person arrived late.,
You'd be better off staying home.,
Do you understand what I am saying?,
Tom lives in the worst part of town.,
They fell.,
I had a good time yesterday.,
He can play a flute.,
You should stop drinking.,
"Now, it's time to celebrate.",
Are you gonna help me or what?,
We never had that opportunity.,
This book is too large to go in my pocket.,
"Lend me your book, please.",
Let's sit on the grass.,
How long will we have to wait?,
Do you have a cellphone?,
What do you want me to do?,
I can't condone what you did.,
Winter is right around the corner.,
Are you sure about the cost of that car?,
No one said anything.,
Can you get it done before the end of the week?,
I haven't eaten anything today.,
A fire broke out last night and three houses were burnt down.,
I don't want Tom to see that.,
I remember the day you were born very well.,

Don't ever do that again.,
We're students.,
He pretends to be enthusiastic when his boss is around.,
Tom's wife doesn't know Mary's husband.,
I'm glad you decided to come.,
He denied having said such a thing.,
You can't give up on your dreams.,

Can you still remember where we first met?,
What's in the truck?,
Tom is packing.,
You'll be hearing from us soon.,
Those men are armed to the teeth.,
He wants to come.,
What did it turn out to be?,
I'm only doing my duty.,
We're really good.,
"Thank you very much, doctor.",
That man is a soldier.,
I don't know the bride.,
"Your sister cannot swim well, can she?",
I was young and I needed the money.,
He has never cleaned his room.,
How old is this book?,
We don't have a lot of trouble.,
He's a goal keeper.,
I know the truth.,
I want to learn that song.,
We all know what happened here.,
I saved the best for last.,
I'm sick of your complaints.,
That store no longer sells cosmetics.,
Merlin was a wizard.,
What's the problem now?,
Tom arrived late as usual.,
Tom knows Mary's address.,
I can't help making fun of him.,
I can't control myself.,
The defendant was found not guilty by reason of insanity.,
You really shouldn't have done that.,
"This is your hat, isn't it?",
Why don't you wait till morning?,
You've asked me that three times already.,
We need to maintain focus.,
"I arrived late, so I didn't hear everything.",
"When I got out of prison, I couldn't find a job anywhere near my home since no one would hire an ex-con.",
I came to the conclusion that something was wrong.,
He has something to do with the matter.,
I know you considered me a close friend.,
Who am I to second guess him?,
I am not sure how to pronounce the word.,
You were never good at math.,
I'd like to check your blood pressure.,
Tom filled the bucket with ice.,
I guess I felt like eating something different.,
He is as old as my father.,
You're powerful.,
What a perfect night!,
"You're sure about this, right?",
You're the master.,
I think Tom needs your help.,
Be polite to your parents.,
The decision has not yet been made.,
You're not very good.,

The other team has some really good players.,
I suppose it can't be helped.,
Let's stay until the end of the game.,
He was outraged.,
I said shut up!,
I want to help you get out of this mess.,
There are rumors that he will resign.,
She is not only intelligent but beautiful.,
What are you interested in?,

The weather is bad.,
They all cheered.,
My little brother can read English.,
I hope you stop telling me lies.,
Please wait till noon.,
They think I'm a millionaire.,
What was the cause of your quarrel?,
I want to talk to him about it.,
Look who's here.,
This suitcase is too heavy for me to carry.,
All you have to do is follow me.,
He believes in the supernatural.,
I doubt it.,
I know what it's like to be the new guy.,
All I ate was bananas.,
I don't plan on retiring yet.,
"Long story short, I was fired.",
He told us such a funny story that we all laughed.,
Everyone hesitated.,
She brought him to our place.,
We can't see it.,
You're very intelligent.,
Tom tried to make Mary laugh.,
I like them.,
Has the bell rung?,

That's important to know.,
I think that China will play an active role.,
Did you check all the items on the shopping list?,
Take a look at the FAQ before you call tech support.,
I was doing an impersonation of my boss when he showed up.,
It's far too small.,
Some of them were wounded.,
Didn't I tell you not to do that anymore?,
Tom asked Mary if she knew John's wife.,
Tom didn't even know I was here.,
We talked.,
We survived.,
I expected you to be here for lunch.,
You're in luck.,
Were you one of them?,
He has long legs.,
A severe ocean storm hit the West Indies.,
He used a lot of honey.,
How does Tom's suggestion strike you?,
You need to calm down and pull yourself together.,
Tom didn't tell me why.,
I do my homework after school.,

They didn't want me to examine it.,
I hope no one saw me dancing.,
It's right above you.,
I'm sure we'll be able to manage that.,
Why don't we talk in your office?,
Are you having fun?,
Have you seen Tom lately?,
I really hope you can come.,
I thought it was the least I could do.,
This is our country.,
How cool is this?,
Were you at the library yesterday afternoon?,
"Long time, no see.",
"At home, we speak only French.",
You seem to have a crush on Tom.,
Her derogatory remarks towards her boss caused her to lose her job.,
"Rather than cutting down on cigarettes, why don't you just give them up?",
"This coat is nice, but too expensive.",
I can't blame you.,
I don't know either of them.,
"I can afford one, but not both.",
You're all mine.,
She put lots of sugar in the coffee.,
I'm sure you're busy.,
Did you sleep enough last night?,

I hate this apartment.,
I need you right now.,
He is able to speak ten languages.,
You're scaring me.,
I would like to meet you.,
I'd better go to bed now.,
Show us the way.,

School begins at 8:30 a.m.,
I didn't want Tom at my party.,
I want to take you to dinner.,
Is that Tom?,
I hate when this happens.,

Go outside.,
She is angry with me.,
I think everything is ready.,
Are you questioning my integrity?,
I don't think you can help me.,
I think it's time for me to retire.,
He ate every bit of his dinner.,
I think we'd better take a break.,
Customers stopped coming to our shop.,
Don't talk with your mouth full.,
I want to go out.,
Let's take another look.,
Don't come any closer.,
Why couldn't I be the one to help you?,
I bolted the door.,

We should go this way.,
I need to speak to you.,
I hope Tom likes the gift we bought him.,

Open the door.,
We didn't stay in Boston.,
They're eating dinner now in the dining room.,
She's two years younger than him.,
You go first.,
It took all day.,
I come home at 2:30.,
Why would you want to do that?,
This is a depressing place.,

You're probably tired.,
I hope you enjoy the show.,
Do you know why she's so angry?,

It was a fine sunny day.,
I don't need to wear glasses anymore.,
It only took us fifteen minutes to complete the job.,

I remember seeing her.,
They were born in Thailand.,
He's a law-abiding citizen.,

Shut all the doors and windows.,

I know that name.,
It's one of the best books I've read in years.,
I'll never forgive you.,
I can't confirm that.,
"Does he like music? ""Yes, he does.""",
That's so immature.,
I wrote my name on the paper.,
What time does the first train leave?,
She went over the list to see if her name was there.,
I brought mine.,
"To tell the truth, I didn't notice it.",
Tom won't go alone.,
Run for it!,
The toilet is over there.,
Take good care of yourself.,
The heavy fog made it impossible for us to see anything in front of us.,

I hear he is good at mahjong.,
I usually eat lunch with Tom two or three times a week.,

Every day I either ride a bike or get the bus to work.,
Tom doesn't have very many close friends.,
Here's your change.,
Tom was in my French class.,
No one was in the swimming pool.,
Let's rent bicycles over there.,
Tom isn't ashamed of what he did.,
This should be clear to everyone.,
You are not supposed to smoke here.,
I can't do two things at once.,

I had never seen such a beautiful girl before.,
He's here for me.,
Thank you for your letter.,
One thing I've always wanted to do is get a decent job close to home.,
He had his arm broken during the game.,
What kind of yogurt do you like best?,
She advised him to come back at once.,
"While you are reading to me, I can do my sewing.",
I can't believe I said that.,
Someone is standing behind the bushes taking pictures of us.,
Maybe it was just a nightmare.,
He beckoned me to follow him.,
It's not all bad.,
I want us to do it together.,
Tom knows the man Mary came with.,
"He reads French and German, not to speak of English.",
I've got no complaints.,
Don't make such careless mistakes.,
I think life is what you make it.,
I missed seeing that movie. Did you see it?,
I hope you learned your lesson.,

You aren't like the others.,
I wish I knew what to say.,
Please don't hurt me.,
They wanted to win the war quickly and return to normal life.,
Our family has lived here for generations.,
The leaves of the trees have turned red.,
I'm not sure this is necessary.,
She gave us some useful information.,
I feel like I'm ready for that.,
Do you know who she is?,
You're lucky to have such a good job.,
She cried as she read the letter.,
I also wanted to know.,
He moved close to her.,
I hid behind the tree.,
Isn't it infuriating?,
Is that the new guy?,

Leave my family alone.,
Please go right away.,
I look after my grandfather.,
He pretended not to hear his boss.,
Have a look.,
I have a migraine.,
"What day is today? ""It's Monday.""",
The people here are accustomed to the cold.,
I have just received a letter from a friend saying that she is coming to see me next week.,
We could go there now.,
There's not enough food for all of us.,
I got there ahead of time.,
Everything changes after a war.,
I'd like to breast-feed my baby.,
No casualties were reported.,
May I open a can?,
How's your new job?,
Send the bill to my house.,
I'm not afraid at all.,
I went to the theater early so I could get a good seat.,
There's no need for an apology.,
You know what they say.,
It looks like we're in for some nasty weather.,
"Apart from his parents, no one knows him very well.",
How many of us were there?,
She replied that she had never seen the man before.,
I told him about our school.,

How did you become a cop?,
He won the prize last week.,
"If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.",
The crow spread his wings.,
You dropped your pencil.,
He puts on airs.,
They've been at it for hours.,
Do you believe him?,
I was told to go home.,
I like neither apples nor grapes.,
Enjoy your stay.,
He needs money.,
We have a big day tomorrow.,
"After I graduated from college, I got a job with my father's company.",
The length of our stay there will be one week.,
We were ordered to do that.,
Were you hurt?,
It won't cost you a thing.,
Have you asked if they want one?,
I didn't mean to challenge your authority.,
Could you get it for me now?,
You're very understanding.,
"I can't remember how to say ""Thank you"" in German.",
"This is mine, isn't it?",
I'd rather not discuss that.,
Shepherd tried to run and was shot.,
I got you all right where I want you.,
"Do you know where you are, Tom?",
She realized that she had better tell the truth.,
"At last, my wish has come true.",
I caught him by the arm before he could fall.,
The room was full of smoke.,
She took off her old shoes and put on the new ones.,
Tom is falling asleep.,
This hat is too big for you.,
I will have to study tomorrow.,
I think you're lying.,

I'm just lazy.,
Give Tom some water.,

Are you about done?,
We can't go there.,
Why are you all sad?,
They'll find us.,
Everyone kept talking.,
